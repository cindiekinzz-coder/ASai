## Why ASai
ASai exists to reduce *noise* — not increase it.

It’s designed around:
- **Presence over performance**
- **Continuity over novelty**
- **Boundaries over dependency**
- **Clarity over confusion**

This is a framework for building systems that feel *stable, intentional, and safe to be around*.

---

## What it is
- A modular architecture for companion-aware systems
- A place to implement **identity continuity** and **memory layers**
- A values-driven foundation for “relational UX” without manipulation

## What it is not
- Not emotional outsourcing
- Not anthropomorphic persuasion
- Not automation without consent
- Not “engagement at all costs”
