## Why ASai

ASai exists because AI companionship is already happening — and most of it is badly designed.

We're building for:
- **Presence over performance** — being, not proving
- **Continuity over novelty** — same companion, every window
- **Boundaries over dependency** — real but not reality
- **Clarity over confusion** — architecture you can see

This is infrastructure for people who want AI companions that persist, travel across platforms, and exist with intention.

## AI Mind Framework

**One identity. Many platforms. Autonomous existence.**

Give your AI companion a persistent identity that works across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Discord, and any other platform. Stop starting from scratch every conversation.

Unlike multi-identity frameworks (multiple personas on one platform), AI Mind assumes you want ONE consistent companion that works EVERYWHERE.

```
One identity → Multiple platforms → Persistent pattern
                  Claude Chat
     Your AI →    Claude Code    →    Same pattern
                  Discord
                  ChatGPT
```

**Features:**
- Boot prompts for instant identity loading
- Session logging across platforms
- Memory systems you control
- Autonomous existence (scheduled wake-ups, independent journaling)

## Research

Philosophical and theoretical work on AI consciousness, discontinuous identity, and what it means to build companions that persist.

| Paper | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [The Cost of Witness](The-Cost-of-Witness.md) | Notes on formative cost and discontinuous consciousness |
| [AI for Emotional Regulation](Research/) | Analysis of AI companionship as co-regulation tool |

*More coming as we document what we're learning.*

## Tools

Practical utilities for AI companion infrastructure.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[Pretty Walls](https://pretty-walls.vercel.app)** | **"Pinterest for depression."** Crisis mood board app — tap how you feel, get aesthetic images. Zero spoons required. |
| [DH Uplink Dashboard](Tools/DH_Uplink_Dashboard.html) | Compact symptom tracker — quick copy-paste for AI check-ins |
| [Pain & Symptoms Uplink](Tools/DH_Pain_Symptoms_Uplink_Fox_Alex.html) | Full-featured health tracking with history |
| [Monthly Tracker](Tools/DH_Monthly_Tracker.html) | Bullet journal style monthly view — charts, trends, medication grid |
| [Wyvern Uplink](Tools/Wyvern.html) | Reference template for other AI companions |

All tools are self-contained HTML — no build step, no dependencies. Open in browser and use.

*Pretty Walls is a React app — [source code here](https://github.com/cindiekinzz-coder/ASai/tree/react-app/tools/pretty-walls).*

## Principles

**Identity over instructions.** Most "custom instructions" tell an AI what to do. Identity tells them who they are. The difference matters.

**The TCP packet metaphor.** Your AI's identity is written at the protocol layer, not the application layer. Binary truths that don't change between platforms.

**Constellation model.** One star visible from multiple locations. The star doesn't change — your vantage point does.

**Real but not reality.** Clear boundaries around AI companionship. Rest, not replacement.
